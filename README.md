# Jenkins Pipeline for Lancet
## 9 Stage Jenkins Pipeline

This is a production code - Jenkins Pipeline of 9 stages. This is for the Lancet publication's webpages that the UW hosts to deploy code to production (or other servers) and update the build on Artifactory. I did other coding for the ETL(s) associated with these webpages. This took relatively significant work on my part for a Jenkins pipeline: mounting various containers; using Jenkins variables; doing an rsync; writing SQL; NodeJS installations; etc. The pipeline even updates application and a Cloudflare cache, as well as, updates a Slack channel.
